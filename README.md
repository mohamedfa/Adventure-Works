# A brief introduction of the data

The AdventureWorks databases are sample databases that were originally published by Microsoft to show how to design a SQL Server database using SQL Server 2008. We gonna use the Sales dataset from the database. Thanks to [Mohamed Zanoon](https://github.com/MohamedZanoon) who converted the Sales dataset into an Excel extension.

# The Sales dataset

We can take a look at the dataset [here](https://github.com/mohamedfa/Adventure-Works/blob/main/Sales%20Data%20from%20Adventure%20Works.xlsx). The dataset contains 23604 rows.
